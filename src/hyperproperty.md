# Hyperproperties

Hyperproperties are a generalization of trace properties. 

A _hyperproperty_ is a _set of sets of traces_ \\(H \subseteq 2^{\Sigma^\omega}\\).

Trace properties can be seen as a set of "accepted" traces, whereas hyperproperties
can be seen as a set of "accepted" systems, where a system is described by 
the set of traces it produces. Hyperproperties can relate traces of a system
to each other.
